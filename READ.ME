This Website This website was created to reach people who are struggling with depression, anxiety, or hopelessness. Sometimes, a few words of encouragement can make a difference. When you click the “HOW” button, you will see a randomly selected sentence that reminds you of your worth, your strength, and your right to rest and heal.

The site also gently encourages reaching out for help: friends, loved ones, or crisis lines if needed. It is free, simple, and accessible for anyone, anywhere.
